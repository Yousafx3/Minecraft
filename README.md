## Termux Guide

Yes, this project works great with [Termux](https://termux.com/). You can use the CLI to operate from your phone. 
Here, is the guide to run this project on Termux. 

### First-Time Setup

* Download and install Termux from [here](https://termux.com/).
* Run `pkg install openjdk-17`
* Run `pkg install wget`
* Run `wget https://github.com/alwyn974/MinecraftBOT/releases/download/v1.0.15/MinecraftBOT-1.0.15-all.jar`

### Starting The Bot

Run `java -jar MinecraftBOT-1.0.15-all.jar --host <hostIP> --port <port> -a --user <username> --password <password>`

Replace `<hostIP>` with your host IP Address (e.g. play.aternos.me), `<port>` with the port, `-a` for enabling AutoReconnect,  `<username>` with your Username/Email and `<password>` with your password (not needed if cracked).

You can use this command for running the Bot.

There is only one tested method of stopping the bot (yet) in Termux.

* Go to Recent Apps
* Tap and Hold Termux
* Press Force Stop in the settings menu.

##### *Options may vary according to device. Tested in MIUI 12.5*

### Tips
