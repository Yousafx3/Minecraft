## Tips

There are environment variable to override the default value of host, port, username and password
- `MC_BOT_HOST` for the host (String)
- `MC_BOT_PORT` for the port (Integer)
- `MC_BOT_USERNAME` for the email/username (String)
- `MC_BOT_PREMIUM` to specify if the Microsoft Authentication should be used (Boolean)
- `MC_BOT_DEBUG` for the debug mode (Boolean)
- `MC_BOT_PREFIX` for the prefix of the commands (default=`.`) (String)
- `MC_BOT_AUTO_RECONNECT` for the auto reconnect mode (Boolean)
- `MC_BOT_RECONNECT_DELAY` for the delay before reconnect (Integer)

They are some builtin commands in the bot

- `difficulty` get the difficulty of the server
- `food` get the food level of the player
- `help` get all the available commands, their description and their usage
- `health` get the health of the player
- `list` get the players connected (Sometimes the packet is glitched, you can use the status button go get the players)
- `pos` get the player position
